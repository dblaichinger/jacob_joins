        By the way: All the entries on this form are not necessarily your final recipe. You forgot salt? No problem! You can adapt every step before you finally share your post on the preview page.

        Just press the + button to add the ingredients which make your recipe special and worth trying. You don´t have or just don´t like one of our 3 already selected ingredients? Just replace it by another one.  Of course you can split the ingredients in two or three courses by explaining the preparation step by step (3). Everybody loves a dessert.

        Jacob wants to know how to do it. Maybe you want to give him a step-by-step instruction to make it easier for him to try your recipe at home. 
        Again you can add or delete steps as required. Plus: He loves pictures!
